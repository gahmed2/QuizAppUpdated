# QuizAppUpdated
This is the third project in Google Udacity Nanodegree for Android Basics. This project is for creating a Quiz App for a certain topic, so
I chose to test the user in Android Development :D
Ihis project is a continuation on the third project form Google Udacity Android Basics Challenge Scholarship with more improvements like:

- Making EditText fields focusable.
- Coloring the Score TextView field based on the user's result (Green for success and Red for Failure)
- Making Toast to tell the user whether he/she passed the quiz or not.
- Adding integers.xml to call integer values from it in java code.
- Updating Intent message when hitting Share button.
